## Description of current state of game

A modern, mesmerizing, and meowtastic game. All of our musician cats, Robin, Sunny, and Tory, have lost their instruments! Help get them back before their debut performance! We are counting on you :3c

Robin will run around, avoiding obstucles, and finding their insturments. Don't worry if you loss a life when you collide into a vase, cat, or bookshelf (cats have 3 lives... wait...). If you miss an insturment, I hope you feel guilty, terrible in fact!!! (Just kidding, enjoy the game, enjoy the process, enjoy the ending)

## Our Idea and Game Plan

- At first we planned to make a **series of 3 minigames**: a running/jumping game, a dodging game, and a strategy
- [x] running
- [ ] dodging
- [ ] strategy
- We wanted to make **multiple endings** depending on items gained from each minigame
- As we began to work on our project, we realized that we had to learn more about javascript and html, as we all did not know much going into this project
- We agreed to use Kaboom, a JavaScript library, to help us implement our game
- We decided to **shorten the game** to what we have now

## Challenges

- As our team is new to web dev and game dev, we really struggled with getting started
- We had many ideas but no idea how to go about them
- We wanted...
- [ ] Randomization for when insturments and obstucles appear
- [x] Change in scenes
- [x] Multiple sprites for cats depending on ending
- [ ] Multiple mini-games
- [x] Lives/Insturment bar
- [x] Game over screen
- Because we couldn't do randomization for when insturments and obstucles appear, we ended up hard coding it :c
- We also really struggled with resizing our graphics
- We also didn't know how to change scenes
- We struggled with the time limit a lot, but we did learn a lot! Yippie! 🐱
