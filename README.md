## Description of current state of game
A modern, mesmerizing, and meowtastic game. All of our musician cats, Robin, Sunny, and Tory, have lost their insturments! Help get them back before their debut performance! We are counting on you :3c

INSERTCATSNAME will run around, avoiding obstucles, and finding their insturments. Don't worry if you loss a life when you collide into a vase, cat, or bookshelf (cats have 3 lives... wait...). If you miss an insturment, I hope you feel guilty, terrible in fact!!! (Just kidding, enjoy the game, enjoy the process, enjoy the ending)

## Our Idea and Game Plan

 - At first we planned to make a series of 3 minigames:  a running/jumping game, a dodging game, and a strategy
  - [x] running
  - [ ] dodging
  - [ ] strategy
 - We wanted to make multiple endings depending on items gained from each minigame 
 - As we began to work on our project, we realized that we had to learn more about javascript and html
 - We decided to shorten the game to what we have now
